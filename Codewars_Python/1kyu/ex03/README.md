This is the SUPER performance version of [**This kata**](https://www.codewars.com/kata/faberge-easter-eggs-crush-test).

You task is exactly the same as that kata. But this time, you should output `result % 998244353`, or otherwise the result would be too large.

# **Data range**

```
sometimes
  n <= 80000
  m <= 100000
while sometimes
  n <= 3000
  m <= 2^200

```

There are `150` random tests. You will need more than just a naive linear algorithm for this task :D
