# **Regular Expression for Binary Numbers Divisible by n**

Create a function that will return a regular expression string that is capable of evaluating binary strings (which consist of only `1`s and `0`s) and determining whether the given string represents a number divisible by `n`.

## **Tests**

Inputs `1 <= n <= 18` will be tested

Each `n` will be tested against random invalid tests and random valid tests (which may or may not pass the regex test itself, accordingly).

## **Notes**

- Strings that are not binary numbers should be rejected.
- Keep your solution under 5000 characters. This means you can't hard-code the answers.
- Only these characters may be included in your returned string:
    
    `01?:*+^$()[]|`
    

## **Python Notes**

- Whenever you use parentheses `(...)`, instead use non-capturing ones `(?:...)`. This is due to `module re`'s restriction in the number of capturing (or named) groups, which is capped at 99.
- Each regex will be tested with `re.search`, so be sure to include both starting and ending marks in your regex.
