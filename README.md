Codewars is an online platform designed to help software developers improve their programming skills through practice. On Codewars, users solve coding challenges known as katas, which are designed to teach programming concepts, algorithms, and problem-solving skills.

Users register on the platform and choose one or more programming languages ​​they wish to practice. Codewars supports a wide range of languages, including Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, Ruby ... 

# Katas
![Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/Ismaelucky342/badges/large)

Katas are coding challenges that vary in difficulty, ranging from very basic to advanced levels. Each kata comes with a problem description, examples of inputs and outputs, and sometimes specific conditions that the solution must meet.
Katas are ranked using a Kyu/Dan system, inspired by the ranking system in Japanese martial arts:
- 8 Kyu is the beginner level.
- 1 Kyu is an advanced level.
- 1 Dan and higher represent expert-level challenges.

Users write and submit their code in an online development environment provided by Codewars. The code is automatically evaluated through a series of tests that check the accuracy and efficiency of the solution.

# Extras 
Despite having reached the current level and having completed numerous challenging katas, this repository will continue to expand as I continue to learn and master new concepts, tackle more complex problems, and explore different programming languages. The learning process never really ends and I am committed to continually improving my skills and sharing those solutions here.

Stay tuned for more updates and new solutions!
